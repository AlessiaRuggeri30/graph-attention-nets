**WARNING - WORK IN PROGRESS**

This project was implemented as a university assignment for the course of *Geometric Deep Learning* at Universit√† della Svizzera Italiana.

Implemenation of MoNet (mixture model CNN) and GAT (Graph Attention Network) tested on MNIST and Cora datasets using Tensorflow.
