# Graph Attention Neural Networks
## Geometric Deep Learning, course assignment - USI, 2019
*Alessia Ruggeri*

This project was implemented as a university assignment for the course of *Geometric Deep Learning* at Universit√† della Svizzera Italiana.

Implemenation of MoNet (mixture model CNN) and GAT (Graph Attention Network) tested on MNIST and Cora datasets using Tensorflow 2.0.
